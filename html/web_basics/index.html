<p>This is a webpage designed to help you understand cats (they are <strong>very</strong> complex!)</p>

<em>Here is a list of info on cats</em>
<ul>
	<li>They are adorable	</li>
	<li>They make cute sounds</li>
	<li>They have sharp claws!</li>
	<li>They aren't dangerous unless provoked</li>



</ul>


If you happen to stumble across a cat in the wild and are unsure of what to do, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Stop and make sure the cat has noticed you</li>
<li>Mimic meowing sounds so the cat is tricked into thinking you are also a cat</li>
<li>Pretend to have fur on your hands and start licking your hands with your tounge</li>
<li>Roll around on the floor and jump on tables, taking special care to knock plates and cups onto the floor</li>

The cat will now welcome you as one of its own, you are a cat person now, yay!
