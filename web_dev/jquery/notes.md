## AFTER TWO HOURS ##


I found a comprhensive YouTube video that was about 1hr and 15 min and I watched it at 1.5 speed picking up the id calls and how to add and animate DOM elements it was super helpful I even downloaded the entire video for future reference I only spent a few minutes creating a html page but with that video in the future I could easily get addition jQuery elements to work with ease.
