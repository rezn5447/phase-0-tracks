What are some common HTTP status codes?
  The two that I am most familar with are 404 and 200
  404 is request not found, it seems that you can still put up some sort of a page when that error occurs
  200 is success and that means the page or request was loaded correctly
  Some other ones that I am not so familiar with are 301 which is moved permanently 
  and 502 bad gateway which I think I have seen before when the page does not load correctly 
  
What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
  A GET request requests data from a specified source while a POST request requests data to be processed from a specified source. 
  I think the difference here is that a server might do specific processing of sensitive data while a GET request will ask for the
  next page after that data is processed.
  
  
  Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
Cookies are saved HTTP information on a computer that a server might ask to access to make data transfer faster between the server and the computer. 
What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Open source for commercial and private use, seems like a completely free and available operating system for anyone looking to build a computer or a server.

  In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
VPS can be run from almost any computer and it is a tiny version of a server that can handle server requests from you web applications. 
Running a VPS allows you to track data coming into and out of your VPS and if something disastrous happens you can always re-create 
the VPS instead of having to wipe an entire server computer.

  Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It seems that giving a program root user access on a Linux system does away with the user permission 
level and allows programs the ability to perform tasks without needing permission. Especially with browsers and 
the like, if there was a virus to get into your computer, it would already have the permission status to execute 
commands without asking or even your knowledge.
