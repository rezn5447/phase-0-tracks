# In phase-0-tracks/ruby/arrays_drill.rb, 
# demonstrate that you can do the following steps, in order. 
# You'll need to use the Array docs to figure out how to accomplish each one, just as you used the String docs to manipulate strings.



# Initialize an empty array and store it in a variable (you can choose the name). Print the variable using p.
drill_array = []


# Add five items to your array. Print the array.
drill_array << ["basketball","baseball","wiffle ball","football","soccer ball"]
p drill_array

# Delete the item at index 2. Print the array.




# Remove the first item of the array without having to refer to its index. Print the array.





# Ask the array whether it includes a certain item. Print the result of this method call (labeled so it prints as more than just an isolated boolean value without any context.)




# Initialize another array that already has a few items in it.




# Add the two arrays together and store them in a new variable. Print the new array.
