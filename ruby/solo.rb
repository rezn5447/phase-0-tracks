### Pseudocode ###

# Hydra monster. several heads have different personality 'traits' that do different things based on their traits

# Gonna need an array of traits.

# Probably want to be able to create a random number of heads too for each monster.

# Some attack method, that makes some heads attack if they have an angry or aggressive disposition

# Maybe if two traits don't get a long there is a chance they will fight with each other

# Cut off head method. that checks if the number that is input is one of the heads available, then cuts that head off. But SURPRISE! 

# When that head is cut off, two more heads pop up in its place! they have to be given random traits too!
