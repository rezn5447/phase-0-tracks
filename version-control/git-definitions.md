# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

-- Version control is the ability to make changes to a file or series of files remotely. It is useful because the changes are non-destructive and you can revert to an older file before changes were made if neccessary. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

-- A branch is a copy of files and folders that can be used for testing before commiting back to the main branch. These are used to test out new features or add changes to files without altering the main branch composition.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

-- A commit is the action of uploading your files to the cloud. This includes any changes made on your local computer. A good commit message would include your reason for this commit or a list of any of the changes made. This makes it easier to track when code breaks down.  


* What is a merge conflict?

--  If two people are working on the same file, and commit changes to the main branch, a merge conflict will show that those people made changes on the same line in a file. this can be resolved in git or in terminal by choosing which edit to save.
